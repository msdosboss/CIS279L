Starndard text Streams are a very powerful tool that can be used to allow mulitple command line programs to interact with each other. It can get very complicated in the implamentation of it.
Currently most of what I use is > or >>. > will overwrite a file with the contents of the stdout whereas >> will append a file with the contents of stdout. 2> will let you redirect the contents
of the stderr. The | opertor works similar to the >> but instead of writing the stdout to a file it will use the stdout of the first program as the stdin to the next (first program | second program)
vs (program >> file)

each file permisions are repersent by 9 bits they are seperated into 3 sections. group permisions, owner permisions, and everyone else. You can edit these permisions with commands such as chown and chgrp.
you can run commands and access files with sudo permission meaning that you would have access to every file and application on the machine.
